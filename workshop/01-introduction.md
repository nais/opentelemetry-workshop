# Lab 0. Introduction

In this section, we will introduce the workshop and the tools and technologies used in the workshop.

## OpenTelemetry Workshop

The goal of this workshop is to provide a hands-on experience with OpenTelemetry as a developer. We will cover the basics of instrumentation, observability, distributed tracing, metrics, and logging.

## Demo Application

The OpenTelemetry Demo is composed of microservices written in different programming languages that talk to each other over gRPC and HTTP; and a load generator which uses Locust to fake user traffic.
